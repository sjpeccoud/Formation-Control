This paper presents a comprehensive study on utilizing a communication-aware formation control model to address various challenges in dynamic multi-agent systems. The research focuses on four key tasks: (1) considering the presence of a fixed agent, (2) accommodating the joining or leaving of an agent, (3) breaking the system into two formations, and (4) operating in the presence of a jamming area. These tasks aim to enhance the mobility and adaptability of the multi-agent system by effectively navigating obstacles and adapting to changing environments. The investigation of the jamming area specifically addresses the impairment of communication between agents. Through this research, a flexible formation control model is proposed, which enables the system to adapt to complex and dynamic scenarios. The results demonstrate the significance of this approach in enhancing the resilience and performance of multi-agent systems in challenging environments.
