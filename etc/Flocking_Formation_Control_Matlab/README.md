## Installation

Install MATLAB to your system, copy the directory `src` to your MATLAB directory or any other directory and open and run any of the files - MSN1.m, MSN2.m, MSN3.m, MSN4.m, MSN5.m, MSN6.m and MSN6switching.m for the 7 cases explained below respectively.

## Project parameters:
- Number of sensor nodes: n =100.
- Space dimensions: m = 2.
- Desired distance among sensor node: d = 15.
- Scaling factor: k = 1.2 and interaction range r = k*d.
- Epsilon = 0.1 and Delta_t = 0.009 (These two parameters are optional and you can change them).

## Cases

### Case 1 - MSN Fragmentation

**Filename: MSN1.m**

- Randomly generates a connected network of 100 nodes in the area of 50x50. 
- Plots the initial deployment of the MSN of 100 nodes.
- Links the neighboring nodes together by a line. 

#### Plots
- Plots the fragmentation of the nodes.
- Plots the velocity.

- Sets up a target (gamma agent) moving in a **circular trajectory.** 
- Implements flocking behavior of the MSN.

#### Algorithm 2 for Case 3 (Same equation, change the values to make it a circular trajectory):

**Filename: MSN5.m**

- Randomly generates a connected network of 100 nodes in the area of 50x50. 
- Sets up a target (gamma agent) at the location of (200, 25). 
- Sets up an obstacle, circular in shape with a radius of 15 and its center location at (100,25). 
- Implements flocking behavior of the MSN avoiding obstacles.

### Case 6 - Implements Leaderless Multi-Agent Flocking

**Filename: MSN6.m, MSN6switching.m**

This is a Leaderless Multi-Agent Flocking, governed by inter-agent potential and a network graph.
